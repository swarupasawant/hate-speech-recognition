# hate-speech-recognition

The hate speech recognition project aimed to develop an intelligent system capable of identifying and classifying hate speech in text data. The project involved implementing natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to create an automated hate speech detection model.

Key Skills Utilized:

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Text preprocessing and feature engineering
Machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Naive Bayes, RNN)
Model training, evaluation, and optimization
Data collection, cleaning, and curation
Performance metrics and evaluation techniques
